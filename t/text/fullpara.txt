Sam Vimes sighed when he שמע את הצרחה, but he finished shaving before he did anything about it.

Then he put his jacket on and strolled out into the wonderful late spring morning. Birds שרו בצמרות העצים, bees buzzed in the blossom. The sky was hazy though, and thunderheads on the horizon threatened rain later. But for now, האוויר היה hot ומעורפל. And in the old cesspit behind the gardener's shed, a young man was treading water.

ובכן ... treading, anyway.

Vimes stood back a little way and lit a cigar. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to employ a naked flame any nearer to the pit. The fall from the shed roof had broken the crust.

"בוקר טוב!" he said cheerfully.

"Good morning, Your Grace," said the industrious treadler.

The voice was higher pitched that Vimes expected and he realized that, most unusually, the young man in the pit was in fact a young woman. It wasn't entirely unexpected -- the Assassins' Guild was aware that women were at least equal to their brothers when it came to inventive killing -- but it nevertheless שינה את המצב במעט.

"I don't believe we've met?" said Vimes. "Although I see you know who I am.  You are ... ?"
